# CODEOWNERS file is a shortcut to identifying required approvers for Pull Requests
# https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-code-owners/
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Default owner for everything in the repo.
*       it.lead@thebridge.io pbelov@jumpmind.com

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches javascript files, only these owners
# will be requested to review.
# *.ts    it.lead@thebridge.io
